Life-Sim - A portable InstLife clone written in C++.

There are 2 parts: the frontend (frontend/) and the backend (backend/).
The frontend has the code that actually display to the screen, and the backend has the code that
simulates the life.

The frontend and backend are designed to be completely independent of one-another, except for one
link: the interface (backend/interface).
